# Iowa-House-Price-Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts house prices in Iowa using the Ames Housing dataset. It implements multiple regression models (Linear, Lasso, Ridge) to estimate sale prices based on house features, with a Streamlit app for interactive predictions. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, performed in Google Colab.

## Features
- Preprocesses the Ames Housing dataset with handling of missing values and feature selection.
- Implements Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge models.
- Evaluates models using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
- Provides a Streamlit interface for user-friendly price predictions.

## Technologies
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Streamlit
- **Tools**: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
- **Core Skills**: Machine Learning, Regression, Data Preprocessing, Web App Development

## Dataset
- Source: Ames Housing Dataset
